McDonald's French Fries (specifically because of their strict cooking timers)\n4. Cheerios\n5. Specific brands of puréed pouches.",

I used a simple laminator and printed icons.",

Favorites include: pushing a laundry basket full of books across the carpet, 'wall push-ups', bear hugs, and wearing a weighted vest for 15 minutes. It's like a reset button for the brain.",

The 'Experience' ones are better for grocery stores. They do amplify your own internal voice/breathing though, which took my kid a week to get used to.",
